## What is DarumaSwap?

DarumaSwap is the decentralised application built by the **DarumaLabs organization** on the Ethereum blockchain.
It consists of multiple [Decentralized Finance (DeFi)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-O3r2YMWJ4) products
which will be described in more detail here.

Like almost any DeFi application, DarumaSwap relies on 3 major components:
- **DarumaSwap Protocol**: A set of smart contracts, completely decentralized, permissionless and censorship-resistant.
It can be considered as the backend of DarumaSwap.
- **DarumaSwap Interface**: A web application that allows to interact with the DarumaSwap Protocol.
- **DARUMA token**: An [ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) token,
used to reward liquidity providers, DARUMA stakers and enabling our governance system.

*\*DarumaSwap is 100% open source, you can find the code on [github](https://github.com/DarumaLabs)*

## What innovations DarumaSwap brings?

Thus far, the main product provided by DarumaSwap is a decentralised exchange (DEX), a platform to exchange
ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, in a decentralised way, following the Automated market maker (AMM) approach
initialy implemented by [Bancor](https://bancor.network/), and widely popularised by [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org).

### Order Book

When it comes to trade assets on a centralised exchange such as Binance or Kraken, the trading is based on the order book model.
With this model, buyers and sellers place orders, buyers wants to buy for as low as possible whereas sellers want to sell
for as high as possible. So their orders converge to a price and the trades can take place. However, what happens if the buyers and sellers
can't agree on a price, or if there's not enough volume to satisfy an order? The market maker, an entity who owns liquidity, will
automaticly fill the orders.

This model works well when implemented in a centralised exchange and is **capital efficient**, which basically means that it doens't need much
liquidity to work. On the other side, when implemented on the Ethereum protocol it leads to a very slow and expensive user experience.
Each order and order cancelation have to be validate on the blockchain, which cost gas fees and time, and because the market maker will spend a
lot of gas by updating its orders, it would go bankrupt quickly.

### Liquidity Pool

An alternative which fits well into the Ethereum protocol is the liquidity pool model. A liquidity pool is an address that holds 2 tokens and works
on the assumption that both quantities of tokens have the same value. This assumption incentivises the liquidity provider who create the
pool to supply an equal value of both tokens. Otherwise, it would lead to an arbitrage opportunity that can result in lost capital for the
liquidity provider. Once the pool is created, the other liquidity providers have to supply tokens by respecting the actual ratio in the pool,
so that, providing liquidity doesn't affect the price of the pool's tokens.

Now that we've described the concept of a liquidity pool, let's take the examaple
of the `DAI/ETH` pool. If I want to buy `ETH` with `DAI`, I will send my `DAI` to the liquidity pool and receive the equivalent amount
of `ETH`. Given that my trade have modified the ratio of tokens in the pool, the value of both tokens will update to the new ratio.
In our example, after the trade there's more `DAI` to the pool and less `ETH`, so the `ETH` value will increase and the `DAI` value will decrease.

### Capital efficiency

The main issue with the AMM approach is the lack of **capital efficiency**. Compared to the order book model, it takes a lot more liquidity
to get a stable market without too much spread and volatility. Which leads to a vicious circle, the less liquidity the pool has,
the less stable the price is, so the higher the risk of capital loss is for liquidity providers due to
[impermanent loss](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/impermanent-loss-explained).

To keep attracting liquidity providers, DEXs seek to reward users willing to bring capital to their platform. Firstly by adding a fee on each
trade (`0.3%` for almost every DEX), and sometimes by allowing the staking of the liquidity tokens to earn the governance token of the protocol,
and so, incentivized liquidity mining even further.

### Concentrated liquidity

**Uniswap V3** introduced the concentrated liquidity as a solution to the lack of capital efficiency. Liquidity providers can chose the price
range in which their liquidity will be used. The whole liquidity of the pool is **concentrated** in multiple custom price ranges instead of
an uniform distribution across the entire price interval (0, âˆž).

The concentrated liquidity is a great innovation as it actually drastically increase the capital efficiency, however, there's some cons:
- **Higher gas fees**: The execution of a trade or liquidity providing is much more complex compared to a basic AMM which leads to an
increase of the gas quantity required to use the protocol.
- **Amplified impermanent loss**: You can think about concentrated liquidity as providing liquidity on leverage. If the price of the pool
falls outside of the range in which you've provided liquidity, you stop earning trading fees and your position is left with only 1 token.
The gains are amplified but the losses too.
- **Irregular spread and volatility**: With the liquidity unevenly distributed across the entire price interval, the spread and volatility
follow an irregular evolution.
